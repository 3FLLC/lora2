Seeing as you're new around here, I'll give you a few tips:

1) èTry to make your messages meaningful.  Also, when replying to someone
   else's message, it's a good idea to quote the last sentence or
   paragraph of their message, so they don't forget what you are talking
   about.  Receiving a message which just says, "I agree," isn't
   very meaningful unless you know the context.

é2) èTry not to be a "file sponge."  This BBS is run by the SysOp
   out of his/her own pocket.  Considering that most of the files
   on here were downloaded from a long-distance site, most SysOps
   don't appreciate users who download *.* and upload nothing in
   return.
